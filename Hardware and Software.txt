Hardware and Software (Fundementals of COmputer Systems)

There are two types of hardware:

External Components(Peripherals): These are the devices the user uses to communicate with the computer e.g. Mouse and Keyboard

Internal Components(Processing + Storage): Housed within the computers casing, it includes all of the circuitry and 
electrical compnents necessary for the fucntioning of the device

Software is necessary for a computer as it represents the instructions for it to carry out. Common types of software includes:
Word Processing Software, MultiMedia playeres and Browsers

On top of that there are two distinct types of Software: Application and System Software

Application Software refers to all of the software the user will interact with/use in order to 
carry out their tasks

System Software exists soley for the necessary fucntioning of the computer. It itself has sub caagotries 
Utilty Programs 
Library Programs
Compilers, assemblers and interpreters 
Operating System Software 

Utility Software
	Used to preform house keeping tasks on the device
	Common examples are include: register cleaners, back-up, file compression amd disk management.

Library Programs:
	Unlike utility programs library programs are essential for certain application (that they where built for)
	Examples include: Graphics Drivers (and most device drivers) memory managment
