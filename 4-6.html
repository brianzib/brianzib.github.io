	<h1 id = "Contents-Pages-Header"> Fundamentals Of Computer Systems </h1>
	<pre> 
	<p>
	A Computer consists of many different parts, physical and intellectual. These parts are classified into either <strong> Hardware </strong>
	or <strong> Software </strong>. Hardware refers to the physical components that make up the computer, e.g. RAM. While software refers 
	to the instructions or more generically: the programs that the computer can run. 
    </p>
	<h2> Classification of Software </h2>
	<p>
	There are two types of software that have two completly different roles. There is <strong> System Software </strong> and <strong> 
	Application Software </strong>. 
	
	System Software refers to the algorithims necessary for the dunctioning of the computer. In other words the computer cannot function
	withought it. An example of System Software is the <strong> Operating System </strong>.
	
	Application Software is completly different. This form of software is a window for the user to be able to interact wwith the computer
	and therefore complete tasks. </p>
	
	<h2> System Software </h2>
	<p>
	System software as stated above is the algorithims utilized to acctually make the computer work.
	Withought these the computer would not be able to function at all. There are several diffrernt types of 
	system software. 
	</p><ul><li> Operating Systems </li><li> Utility programs </li><li> Libraries </li><li> Translators (complier, assembler, interpreter) </li></ul>
	<p>
	The operating system provides an interface between the user and the Hardware. This is not acurate as the user 
    does not acctually directly interact with the hardware, but rather via the application software. 
	operating system also comes with a number of utility programs like:
	<p>
	<ul><li> Encryption Software </li><li> COmpression Software </li><li> Defragmentation Software </li></ul>

	<h2> Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra </h2>
	
	Logic gates are ciruits that take an input and provide an output based on a certain type
	of logical condition. 
	There are different types of Logic gates:
	<ul>
	<li> AND gate. It takes two inputs (either 1 or 0). In order for it to return a true value (1) both 
	Input values have to be true to begin with</li>
	
	<img src = "AND g.png" alt = "And Gate"> <img src = "AND truth.png">
	
	<li> OR gate. It takes two inputs (either 1 or 0). in order for it to return a true value
	one of the input value must be true </li>
	
	<img src = "OR g.png" alt = "OR Gate"> <img src = "OR truth.png">
	
	<li> NOT gate. It only takes 1 value as an input, and flips whatever than value is
	(so 1 = 0 and 0 = 1)</li>
	
	<img src = "NOT g.png" alt = "NOT Gate"> <img src = "NOT truth.png">	
	
	<li> NOR gate. It takes two inputs (either 1 or 0). It only outputs a true value if <Strong> BOTH </Strong>
	values are negative </li>
	
	<img src = "NOR g.png" alt = "NORGate"> <img src = "NOR truth.png">
	
	<li> XOR gate. It takes two inputs (either 1 or 0). In order for it to return a true value
	One of the two values must be true, but only one or else it returns a fales (0) value</li>
	
	<img src = "XOR g.png" alt = "XOR Gate"> <img src = "XOR truth.png">
	
	<li> NAND gate. It takes two inputs (either 1 or 0). It outputs a true value when there is a false value
	as an input	</li>
	
	<img src = "NAND g.png" alt = "NAND Gate"> <img src = "NAND truth.png">
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	These logic circuits can be combined to produce different results based on certain conditions. It is also possible to do 
	arithmatic functions with these circuits. In the specification only <strong> half and full adders </strong> are covered. 
	</p>
	
	<h3> Half and Full bit adders </h3>
	<p>
	These are circuits that utilize boolean login in order to complete addition. A half adder adds two bits together giving answer and a carry out. 
	A Full-adder adds two bits together and takes into account the carry in form the last addition, aswell as giving out a carry and a data bit.
	</p>
	<caption> This is a half adder </caption>
	<img id = "Half-Adder" src = "Half Adder.png" alt = "Image of a Half adder">
	
	<caption> This is a Full adder </caption>
	<img id = "Full-Adder" src = "Full Adder.png" alt = "Image of a Full adder">
