	<pre> 
	
	<h2> Introduction to Data Representation </h2>
	
	Data representatio is a way of showing a number which can represent a piece of data in several different ways.
	First lets take a look at the different types of numbers there are before we dive into the forms that they can take.
	
	<ul><li> Integer Numbers: These are whole numbers including both positive and negative numbers </li><li> Rational Numbers: These are numbers that are either integers or can be written as a fraction of an integer </li><li> Irational Numbers: These are numbers that <strong> cannot </strong> be written as a fraction of an integer </li><li> Ordinal Numbers: These are numbers that refer to a posiion of an item in relation to other items of significance e.g. <br> First, Second, Third etc </li><li> Real Numbers: A set for all numbers in the following catagories: Natural, Rational and Irrational numbers </li></ul>

	<h2> Number Bases </h2>

	<p>
	There are different types of ways to show a single value, these are known as number bases. 
	There are 3 types of number bases that are covered in the spec as well as an extra onemptied
	</p>
	<ol><li> Denary (0 - 9) </li><li> Binary (1 and 0) </li><li> Hexadecimal or HEX (0 - 9 the A for 10, B for 11 and so on up to F which is 15)</li></ol>
	<br> 
	There is an extra type of number base which is not mentioned in the spec known as OCT (0 - 8) but we willl not talk
	about it here.
	
	<h2> Data converstion </h2>
	<p>
	Since there are different ways to display a single value there must also be ways to convert the value between the differnt number bases.
	All number bases can be converted to each other with a few simple steps. However, as the number values become larger it becomes
	more and more complecated to convert and therefore: in exams you will not have to generally convert number larger than <em> 8 bits </em> 
	</p>
	
	<h3> Binary to Denary Coverstion </h3>
	<p>
	A binary number can be converted to denary (and vice versa) using the grid below, which goes up to 8 bits (255).<p>
	<img src = "Conver.jpg" alt = "A Binary Conversion Grid">
	<p>
	The process is fairly simple. You go from the largest available number in the grid,
	and total the numbers as you go along for each 1 present in the grid. Please bear in mind the kind of binary number it is 
	If it is unsigned take the end result to always be positive. Otherwise a 1 at the start of the number is a signature for the
	number being negative, and a 0 for it being positive.<p>
	
	<h3> Denary to Binary </h3>
	<p>
	The above process can simply be reversed in order to get the binary equivalent of a denary value:
	<ol><li> Go from left to right subtracting the largest possible number from the number you are converting in relation to the grid </li><li> Place a 1 for every part of the grid where you have subtracted the corresponding number </li><li> Total the numbers to make sure you havent made any mistakes </li></ol>
	
	<h3> Binary to Hexadecimal </h3>
	<p> The same grid can be used to convert Binary to Hexadecimal as Binary to denary. Except the process is slighly 
	different.<p>
	<ol><li>Place the 1s and 0s in the grid as you normally would (left to right).</li><li>Split the grid in half each half being 4 bits (15, 1 - 8).</li><li>Add up the Numbers as you were converting it to denary and then convert the denary value to the corresponding HEX</li></ol>
