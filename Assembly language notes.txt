For the exam you will be using the instruction set issued by the Exam bored (AQA)
This instruction set for assembly language is different from other instructions sets and mus tbe followed 
closely otherwise you will loose marks.
<p>
<ul>
	<li> To load an instruction you will use the LDR command, then specify the register which will store
	the following values in the listed memory directory </li>
	<img src ="AQA load.png" alt = "AQA load command"> 
	<li> To store a vlaue you will use the STR command, then specify the register which will then take the value 
	in that register and store it the the following memeory loaction (given using <memory ref>)</li>
	<img src = "AQA store.png" alt "AQA store command">
	<li> To add two values together you will use the ADD command, then give two registers, the first is where 
	the end result will be stored and the second is where the number you are adding to is currently stored.
	You will the enter the second number you would like to use to do the addition using <> with the number inside </li>
	<img src = "AQA add.png" alt = "AQA addition command">
	<li> To subtract two numbers using assembly language you will use the SUB command. This works in the same way
	the addition command works except it subtracts rather than adds </li>
	<img src = "AQA sub.png" alt = "AQA subtraction command">
	<li> To move a value from the operand into a register you first use the MOV command, 
	followed by the register you are copying into and then the operand </li>
	<img src = "AQA MOV.png alt = "AQA copy value command">
	<li> In order to compare two values you must first use the CMP command
	you would then call the register that you would be using to compare agiant and the 
	value you are comparing in <> </li>
	<img src = "AQA CMP.png>
	<li> To use the branch command, whihc is called upon using B. YOu would then in <>
	write the label, this must be identical to the other label as this is where it will jump to when 
	the bracn command is called upon </li>
	<img src = "AQA branch.png" ald = "AQA branch command">
	<li> If you would like to branch to an instructyio only when a specific condition is met, you would
	first call the branch command, as stated before using B, then you would give the condition in angled brackets
	After you have done that you give the label that you want to branch to. </li>
	<img src = "AQA branch cond.png" ald = "AQA branch command">
	<img> If you would like to use a bitwise operator, you would call the command, the register you would like to store the result in
	the register with the value you are testing against and the operand </li>
	<img src = "AQA AND> <img src = "AQA NOT> <img src = "AQA OR> <img src = "AQA XOR>
</ul>
